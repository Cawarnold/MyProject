//////////////
////// Lesson 1/8 Introduction

// Welcome to Learn JavaScript!

// JavaScript is the most widely used programming language on the web 
// and is used on most websites, including this one.

// By the end of this course, you'll have a strong foundation in JavaScript. 
// You'll be able to write full-fledged programs, make HTML and CSS dynamic,
// and write impressive web applications.


// This unit has two parts:

	// Learn the building blocks of JavaScript
	// Do some fun stuff with those parts

// Because this course starts with the building blocks of JavaScript, 
// make sure to take notes and pace yourself. 
// This foundation will take us through the rest of the JavaScript course.


//////////////
////// Lesson 2/8 Types

// The building blocks of JavaScript make up every program and line of JavaScript.

// Just like a language has nouns, verbs, and prepositions, 
// JavaScript has its own building blocks. 
// Instead of calling them building blocks, however, developers call them data types.


// There are three essential data types to know for now, 
// and here is your first test of memorization 
// (don't worry, we will practice):

	// String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by 
			//	single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ".

	// Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, 
			// without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.

	// Boolean: This is always one of two words. 
			// Either true or false, with no quotations.


//// Question:

	// In the code editor, there are three variables 
	// (we will learn about variables in the next lesson). 
	// For now, replace each variable's value with each corresponding type.

	// On line 1, there's a variable named myString equal to undefined. 
	// Replace undefined, with a string of your name.

//// Console Before:
var myString = 'undefined';
var myNumber = undefined;
var myBoolean = undefined;


// Do not edit the code under this line
console.log("Name: " + myString);
console.log("Lucky Number: " + myNumber);
console.log("Good joke? " + myBoolean);

//// Console After:
var myString = 'Christian';
var myNumber = 28;
var myBoolean = true;


// Do not edit the code under this line
console.log("Name: " + myString);
console.log("Lucky Number: " + myNumber);
console.log("Good joke? " + myBoolean);


//////////////
////// Lesson 3/8 console

// We can't do much programming with our knowledge of types right now, 
// so let's build something cool. 
// Let's learn how to ask JavaScript to talk to us.

// To do this, we need two things:

// A way to ask JavaScript to talk.
// Something for JavaScript to say.
// We can ask JavaScript to print words to the console with this line of code:

console.log('Your message here.');

// In human-speak, this is saying: 
	// "Hey console, please print/log this thing inside the parentheses. Bye, thanks!"

// By writing this line, we've also solved the second thing we need: 
// Something for JavaScript to say. 
// We can put a String, Number, or Boolean (or any data type) 
// inside the parentheses of a console.log statement.


// Fun fact: We can log multiple things at once by separating them with commas, like this:

console.log('bacon', 'pesto');

// Use console.log to print out two of your favorite pizza toppings (plural).

//// Console:

console.log("Chorizo", "tomato");


//////////////
////// Lesson 4/8 Math Operators

// Don't worry, math does not need to be your strong-suit to learn JavaScript. 
// There are just a few operations we'll need to know 
// to make some awesome programs later in the course!).

// JavaScript includes the general math operators that you can find on a calculator:

	// Add: +
	// Subtract: -
	// Multiply: *
	// Divide: /

// These all work how you might guess: 3 + 4 will equal 7, 50 / 10 will equal 5.

// Let's use each one of these math operators.

//// Instructions:

// Inside of a console.log:
	// add 3.5 to your age.
	// take the current year and subtract 1969.
	// then divide 65 by 240.
	// then multiply the full answer from step 3 by 100.

//// Console:

console.log(38+3.5);
console.log(2016-1969);
console.log(65/240);
console.log(65/240*100);


//////////////
////// Lesson 5/8 Math Operators II

// Now let's generate a space fact 
// while we learn a brand new operator called the modulus.

// The idea behind the modulus is to show you the remainder after you divide a number.

// So, if you divide 13 / 5, 5 goes into 13 two times, 
// and there will be 3 remaining. A modulus, denoted by a %,
// would take 13 % 5 and return the remainder 3.

// How on Earth is this useful?
// Let's ask a question a modulus can solve:
	// What will the moon phase be one year from today?

//// Instructions:

// Let's say it's a full moon tonight, 
// and we want to know what the moon will look like one year from today. 
// We know from the moon phase image to the right that 
// the moon circles the Earth every 27 days, 
// so let's start by dividing 365 by 27.

// Remember to put your calculations inside console.log to print them to the screen.

//// Console:

console.log(365/27);

// That gives us a number (13), followed by a decimal(.518...).
// To figure out what phase the moon will be in a year, 
// we need to know how many extra days the moon will rotate 
// around the earth before the end of the year. 
// We need the decimal we just found displayed as remaining days.
// Use the modulus operator to find the remaining days, then run your code.

console.log(365%27);

// Now we know how many days into the moon's phase it will be in exactly one year.

// We can now figure out, based on the moon phase image, 
// what the moon phase will be 365 days from today. 
// If it's a full moon today, a year from now it will be a new moon.


//////////////
////// Lesson 6/8 Random

// As it turns out, JavaScript has some tricks up its sleeve to make our lives easier.

// JavaScript has built in functions, which help us do everyday things. 
// We'll learn more about functions later in the course, 
// so don't worry about understanding what they are right now.

// Sometimes it's necessary to generate a random number within a program. 
// We can do that with this code:

Math.random();

// This code will return a random number between 0 and 1. 
// JavaScript will generate a random number for us with this code.

// To generate a random number between 0 and 50, 
// we could multiply this result by 50, like so:

Math.random() * 50;

// The problem with this is that the answer will most likely be a decimal. 
// Luckily, JavaScript has our back with another built in function called Math.floor. 
// Math.floor will take a decimal number, 
// and round down to the nearest whole number. It is used like this:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);

// In this case:
// Math.random will generate a random number between 0 and 1.
// We then multiplied that number by 50, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
// Then, Math.floor will round the number down to the nearest whole number.
// Let's utilize these two methods to generate a random number between 0 and 100.


//// Instructions:

// Inside of a console.log, create a random number with Math.random, 
// then multiply it by 100.

// If you run the program few times, you'll see random numbers in the console.

//// Console:

console.log(Math.random() * 100);

// Now, utilize Math.floor to make the output a whole number.

// Inside the console.log you wrote in the last step, 
// put Math.random() * 100 inside the parentheses of Math.floor.

//// Console:

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));


//////////////
////// Lesson 7/8 Comments

// As we write JavaScript, we can create comments in our code.

// Comments are lines that are not evaluated when the code runs. 
// They exist just for human readers, in other words. 
// Comments can be extremely useful when we're looking back at code 
// we've written later on and for other people who will be looking at your code.

// There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

	// A single line comment will comment out a single line, 
	// and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding a line of JavaScript code.

// The first 5 decimals of pi
console.log('Pi is equal to ' + 3.14159);

	// A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines, 
	// and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.

/*
console.log('All of this code');
console.log('Is commented out');
console.log('And will not be executed);
*/

//// Instructions:

// Let's practice adding some code comments.

// To the right, we've provided you with the beginning 
// of the book Catch-22 by Joseph Heller.

// On line 1, write a single line comment that says 'Opening line'.

// Single line comments are great for adding context to your code.

// Multi-line comments are often best suited to prevent 
// a block of code from running. Comment out lines 4 - 9 with a multi-line comment.

// Opening line
console.log('It was love at first sight.');

/*console.log('The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.');
console.log('Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.');
console.log('The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn\'t quite jaundice.');
console.log('If it became jaundice they could treat it.');
console.log('If it didn\'t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.');
console.log('But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.');*/


//////////////
////// Lesson 8/8 Review Types and Operators

// Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

// There are three essential data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, and booleans.
// We can write out anything to the console with console.log.
// We can do math with operators like +, -, *, and /.
// We can find the remainder after dividing two numbers with a modulus: %.
// We can generate a random number with Math.random, 
	// then make it a whole number with Math.floor.
// We write a single line comment with // and a multi-line comment with /* and */.
// You've just finished one of the toughest parts of this course, nice work!


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//////////////
// Variables
//////////////

//////////////
////// Lesson 1/6 Variables

// To write programs in JavaScript, we'll need to make our code reusable.

//  Part of making code reusable is removing the data we want to perform 
// some logic on to leave only the logic. 
// Then we can use our logic on any data. 

// Here's what we mean:
// Imagine you're writing a weather app. 
// Your thermometer outside reports the temperature in Celsius 
// and your goal is to report the temperature in Fahrenheit.

// You write a program that takes a temperature like 15 degrees Celsius, 
// then multiplies and divides it until you get the temperature in Fahrenheit.

// Once you've done this though, you see the temperature now reads 16 degrees Celsius. 
// In order to find Fahrenheit again, you'd need to write a whole new program 
// to convert 16 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.

// This would happen because the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit logic 
// is operating directly on the Celsius data.

// Luckily, JavaScript offers variables. 
// Variables allow us to assign data to a word, 
// then we can use that word within our program instead of the data. 
// Then, if the variable's value changes we only have to change 
// the variable's value instead of re-writing the entire program.


//////////////
////// Lesson 2/6 Create a Variable

// Let's dive in and see a variable in the wild. Here is how you declare a variable:

var myName = 'Arya';
console.log(myName);
// Output: Arya

// You can almost read it aloud: "Variable myName is equal to Arya."

// Let's dissect that statement and look at its parts:

	// var, short for variable, 
			//is the JavaScript keyword that will create a new variable for us.
	// myName is chosen by a developer (that's you!). 
			// Notice that the word has no spaces, 
			// and each new word is capitalized. 
			// This is a common convention in JavaScript, 
			// and is called camelCase.
	// = means to assign whatever's next to the variable.
	//'Arya' is the value that the equals = assigns into the variable myName.

// After the variable is declared, 
// we can print the variable with: console.log(myName). 
// This will print 'Arya' to the console.

//// Instructions:

// Variables must be strong to hold all of our stuff. Exactly how strong are they?
// Create a variable named strength, and assign the string '50,000 pounds' to it.

//// Console 1:

var strength = '50,000 pounds';

// Now, under the strength variable, type

//// Console 2:

console.log('How much stuff can a variable hold? ', strength);

// Now we know: What can a variable hold? Just about anything!


//////////////
////// Lesson 3/6 Create a Variable II

// If variables can hold strings, can they hold other data types? 
// Let's give it a shot:

var myAge = 15;
var likesChocolate = true;

console.log(myAge);
// Output: 15

console.log(likesChocolate);
// Output: true

// Variables can hold any data type, like strings, numbers, and Booleans. 
// They can also hold data types that we have not learned yet, 
// like arrays, functions and objects (more on that later).


//// Instructions:

// Under the strength variable, create a new variable named age 
// and set it equal to your age as a number.

var age = 28;

// Under your age variable, use console.log to print it to the console.

console.log(age);

// Now, create another variable named hasPet, and set it equal to a boolean.
// Then, print it to the console with console.log.

var hasPet = false;
console.log(hasPet);


//////////////
////// Lesson 4/6 Changing a Variable's Value

// Why do we care about variables?

// Variables are useful in two ways:

// They allow us to use the same value over and over, 
/// without having to write a string or other data type over and over.

// More importantly, we can assign variables different values 
// that can be read and changed by the program without altering our code.

// For example, a weather app can show you a different high temperature every day. 
// Instead of writing a new website everyday, 
// they store the information in a variable 
// and just change the value of that variable.

// We can change a variable's value if we want, like this:

var weatherCondition = 'Monday: Raining cats and dogs';
weatherCondition = 'Tuesday: Sunny';

console.log(weatherCondition); 
// Output: 'Tuesday: Sunny'

// We created a variable by using the keyword var and the name weatherCondition.
// Then, we took the existing weatherCondition variable, 
// and set its value equal to 'Tuesday: Sunny'.
// True to their name, variables are indeed variable.

//// Instructions:

// Create a variable on line 1 named morningAlarm and set it to '6:30AM'.

var morningAlarm = '6:30AM';

// On line 2, set morningAlarm equal to another time that's better for you, that is not at 6:30AM.

morningAlarm = '7:30AM';

// On line 3, use

console.log('Morning alarm is set to: ', morningAlarm)
// to print out your alarm to the console.
// Notice that you successfully changed the variable's value 
// because of your code on line 2.


//////////////
////// Lesson 5/6 String Interpolation


// In the previous lessons, we've put strings into variables. 
// Now, let's put a variable's value into a string!

// Putting a variable in a string uses concepts we've already learned. 
// The JavaScript term for this idea is interpolation.

// Interpolwhat?! —Possibly the most fun JavaScript term to say.

// We can use the + operator from earlier to interpolate (insert) 
// a variable into a string, like this:

var myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'


//// Instructions:

// Create a variable named favoriteAnimal and set it equal to your favorite animal.

var favoriteAnimal = 'Lion';

// Then, use console.log to print: 'My favorite animal: Koala', 
// but replace 'Koala' with your favoriteAnimal variable.

console.log('My favorite animal: ' + favoriteAnimal);


//////////////
////// Lesson 6/6 Review Variables

// You made it to the end of the first unit and this lesson! High five!

// We learned:

	// How to create variables.
	// How to change a variable's value.
	// How to interpolate, or insert, a variable into a string.

//In the next lesson, we will learn how to program JavaScript 
// to make decisions for us and how to generate random numbers. 
// Let's go!
