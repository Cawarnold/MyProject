Overview of Useful code:

#### SUMMARY OF USEFUL CODE ####

# we have some data on wine quality

# Each row is a different wine
# Each Column is an attribute of that wine

# Columns include: density, ph, alcohol, quality(rating_by_expert-1to10)

# goint to try to predict the quality using the different columns here
## Linear Regression, allows us to compare two sets of values, 
## train an algoritm to predict new values.

# eg. use density, feed in density data. feed in quality. pedict quality based on density.

#### Drawing_Lines ####

#Before we get started with linear regression, let's take a look at how to draw lines.
# The simplest possible line is y=xy=xy=x. 
# This means that the value of a point on the y-axis is the same as the corresponding value on the x-axis.
