#### Equal_interval_scales ####

# Statistics is, at the core, about counting and measuring.
# In order to do both effectively, we have to define scales on which we can count.
# One type of scale is called equal interval.
# Think of the speed of a car. 5 miles per hour is 5 miles per hour, no matter what the current speed is.
# The difference between 60 and 55 miles per hour will always equal the difference between 10 and 5 miles per hour in real-world terms.
# Another type of scale is a logarithmic scale.
# The difference between a 6 and a 5 on the Richter scale is more than the difference between a 4 and 5.
# This is because each number on the Richter scale means that the earthquake had 10 times the shaking amplitude of the previous number.
# So, a 6 is 10 times more powerful (technically, powerful is the wrong term, but it makes explaining easier) than a 5,
# which is 10 times more powerful than a 4. A 6 is 100 times as powerful as a 4.
# We can calculate the mean of values on an equal interval scale by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.
# We could do the same for values on a non-equal interval scale, but the results wouldn't be meaningful, 
# because of the differences between units.
