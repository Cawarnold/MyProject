Beggining with the Basics

# A number without decimals is an integer type.
# An integer can hold negative and positive values
# We can do do math with integers.
a = 5
b = -1
print(a * b)

# Anything enclosed in single or double quotes is a string.
# Strings hold text.
# We can't do math with strings like we can with integers.
# But there are some operations we can do (that we will learn later on).
c = "I am a string.  I do string-like things."
d = 'Also a string!'

# Floats are numbers with decimal points.
e = 5.1
f = 10.2
g = e * f

# There are other types that we will learn about later on.

h = 1
i = "hello"
j = 1.2

########

# The type function has only one input value.
a = type(5)

# The above code invokes the type function on the input 5, and as the output, we get the type of 5.
# The type is assigned to a.


# We can also invoke functions on variables.
b = "DataQuest is the best thing ever"
# Note how when the type for b is printed, it is abbreviated to str.
print(type(b))

c = type(1)
d = type("racecar")
e = type(10.6)
